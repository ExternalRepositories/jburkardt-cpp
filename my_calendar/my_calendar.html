      MY_CALENDAR <br> Simple calendar reminder utility
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MY_CALENDAR</b>
      is a C++ program which
      carries out a simple calendar reminder service.
    </p>

    <p>
      It reads the file "calendar" stored
      in the user's home directory.  It prints every
      line that contains a string suggesting today's date, or
      "nearby" dates.  On Sunday through Thursday, a nearby date
      is today or tomorrow.  On Friday and Saturday a nearby date
      includes today through Monday.
      Most reasonable combinations of dates are recognized.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some things happen every Monday or Thursday, and it is
      natural to record in your calendar file a single entry
      that reads:
      <pre>
        Mondays - Pay blackmailer
      </pre>
      <b>MY_CALENDAR</b> will recognize such a line, and
      print it every Monday, ensuring prompt payment.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>my_calendar</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          will read the file <i>calendar</i> in your home directory,
          and print out lines referring to today or tomorrow.
        </dd>
      </dl>
