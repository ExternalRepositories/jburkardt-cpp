      DELAUNAY_TREE_2D <br> Delaunay Triangulation of 2D Data
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DELAUNAY_TREE_2D</b>
      is a C++ program which
      reads a file of point coordinates in 2D and produces a PostScript file containing
      an image of the Delaunay triangulation of the points,
      by Olivier Devillers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Warning:</b> A limitation of the program is that it assumes
      that the user's input coordinates are "reasonable" PostScript coordinates!
      Reasonable results will be achieved then if both X and Y coordinates
      are positive and range from 0 to 1000 or so, say.  On the other hand,
      a user whose data is in the unit square will get a PostScript
      file which actually plots the entire image in a near infinitesimal
      and useless box!  A reasonable fix is to rescale data so that it
      lies between 0 and 612.  (The PostScript coordinates, by default,
      are in units of 1/72 inch, so 8.5 inches wide = 612.)
    </p>

    <p>
      It would not be hard to correct the code so that the user can
      input data with any scaling whatsoever, while the program would
      (simple) just rescale it, or (better) insert the appropriate
      PostScript scaling commands in the plot file.
    </p>

    <p>
      In any case, the program is more interesting for being a
      fairly clean embodiment of a Delaunay triangulation algorithm,
      and the author himself suggests that a user might profitably
      and easily modify the code to write out the information defining
      the triangulation.
