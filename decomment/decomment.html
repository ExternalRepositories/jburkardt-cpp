      DECOMMENT <br> Remove "#" comment lines
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DECOMMENT</b>
      is a C++ program which
      makes a copy of a file
      in which all lines beginning with the "#" character have been removed.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a common convention to indicate comments in a file
      by an initial "#" character.  I often use this convention in
      my data files, and it is part of the TABLE format However, certain 
      hard-hearted or soft-headed
      programs will not accept comment lines.  The <b>DECOMMENT</b>
      program allows me to comment my data files, but then to easily
      make an uncommented version, when necessary, to feed to
      illiterate programs.

      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>old</i> is the file to be modified;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>new</i> is the modified copy of the old file.
