      REWORD <br> Reword a File to Have Fixed Number of "Words" Per Line
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>REWORD</b> 
      is a C++ program which 
      reads a text file and makes a copy in which every line has the same number of "words" 
      - that is, strings separated by blanks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user specifies the number of words per line.

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>reword</b> <i>old</i> <i>new</i> <i>word_length</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>old</i> is the file to be modified;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>new</i> is the modified copy of the old file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>word_length</i> is the number of words per line.
        </li>
