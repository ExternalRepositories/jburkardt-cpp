      RECOMMENT <br> Convert comments from C to C++ form
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>RECOMMENT</b>
      is a C++ program which
      converts C style comments to C++ style comments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recall that C style comments begin (anywhere) with the
      marker <b>/*</b> and end (anywhere) with the marker <b>*/</b>.
      C++ comments begin anywhere with the string <b>//</b> and
      continue to the end of the current line.
    </p>

    <p>
      This code incorporates suggestions and coding provided on 28 April 2005
      by Steven Martin of JDS Uniphase, Melbourne Florida.  These
      suggestions allow the program to ignore the internal contents
      of strings, (which might otherwise seem to begin or end comments),
      to handle lines of code with trailing comments, and to handle
      comments with trailing bits of code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Warning: a number of operating systems pretend to honor the
      difference between capital and lowercase letters but for
      various reasons of "convenience" do not actually do a proper job.
      My current complaint is about Macintosh OSX; when you set up your hard
      drive, you have one chance to choose whether it is "case sensitive"
      or not.  After that, you can't change the option without wiping
      the disk.  A consequence is that, although you can name a file
      "fred.c" or "Fred.C" and see the letters in the case you chose,
      at certain points, the operating system makes no distinction
      between upper and lower case.  In particular, it is common to
      use "fred.c" to denote a C file and "fred.C" to denote a C++ file.
      On a Macintosh OSX system without strict case sensitivity, this
      means that a disaster will occur should you issue the command
      <blockquote>
        recomment fred.c fred.C
      </blockquote>
      As far as the operating system is concerned, you have asked it
      to read and write using the same file.  And so...it doesn't create
      the output file, and <i>it overwrites the input file</i>...yes,
      it's gone!  For this reason, the program has been modified to
      refuse to accept an output file which is identical to the input
      file except for case.

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>recomment</b> <i>old.c</i> <i>new.c</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>old.c</i> is the file to be recommented.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>new.c</i> is the new file, to be created from <i>old.c</i>,
          but using C++ style comments.
        </li>
      </ul>
