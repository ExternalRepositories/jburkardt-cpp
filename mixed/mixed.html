      <b>MIXED</b>
      is a directory of C++ programs which
      illustrate some issues in doing mixed language programming.

    <p>
      Because higher level languages end up as machine code, there is
      some reason to assume that you can write parts of a program in
      two different languages; what is <b>not</b> standard is the
      protocol for dealing with the differences in languages.
    </p>

    <p>
      C++ supports (on purpose!) a scheme in which the names chosen
      by a user for various functions are automatically <i>mangled</i>,
      because it is assumed likely that the same name could be used
      in different namespaces, so C++ avoids ambiguity by constructing
      unique internal names when compiling.  Unfortunately, this makes
      it very difficult for programs written in other languages to
      interact with a C++ program.  One feature that can help
      is the use of the statement
      <pre>
        external "C" { (list of function declarations) }
      </pre>
      in a C++ program in which name mangling is to be deactivated.
      The list of function declarations can be either the names of
      C routines to be called from this C++ routine, OR the names
      of internal C++ routines that are to be called by an external
      C routine.
