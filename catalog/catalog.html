      CATALOG <br> List marked routines in a Fortran or C++ file
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CATALOG</b> 
      is a C++ program which 
      produces a table of contents of
      a file containing C, C++, FORTRAN77, FORTRAN90, or MATLAB routines.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>CATALOG</b> only works if each routine has been marked in the 
      appropriate way.
    </p>

    <p>
      For C programs, the necessary marker is '  Purpose:'.  <b>CATALOG</b>
      will print the line that comes two lines later, and assumes
      that the first 4 characters of that line are blank.
      <pre>
        void doodah ( int a, int b, int *c )
        
        /**********************************************************
        
          Purpose:
        
            DOODAH computes the mangletude of A hepcatted to B.
        
        ...(further text of the routine follows)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For C++ programs, the necessary marker is '//  Purpose:'.  <b>CATALOG</b>
      will print the line that comes two lines later, and assumes
      that the first 6 characters of that line are to be ignored.
      <pre>
        void doodah ( int a, int b, int *c )
        
        //*********************************************************
        //
        //  Purpose:
        //
        //    DOODAH computes the mangletude of A hepcatted to B.
        //
        ...(further text of the routine follows)
      </pre>
    </p>
 
    <p>
      For FORTRAN77 programs, the necessary marker is 'cc'.  <b>CATALOG</b>
      will print the remainder of any such line.  This marker must
      begin in column 1, and INDEX assumes that the third character
      is a blank, and ignores it.  I use the marker as follows:
      <pre>
              subroutine doodah ( a, b, c )
        
        c**********************************************************
        c
        cc DOODAH computes the mangletude of A hepcatted to B.
        c
        ...(further text of the routine follows)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For FORTRAN90 programs, the necessary marker is '!!'.  <b>CATALOG</b>
      will print the remainder of any such line.  This marker must
      begin in column 1, and INDEX assumes that the third character
      is a blank, and ignores it.  I use the marker as follows:
      <pre>
        subroutine doodah ( a, b, c )
        
        !**********************************************************
        !
        !! DOODAH computes the mangletude of A hepcatted to B.
        !
        ...(further text of the routine follows)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For MATLAB programs, the necessary marker is '%%'.  <b>CATALOG</b>
      will print the remainder of any such line.  This marker must
      begin in column 1, and INDEX assumes that the third character
      is a blank, and ignores it.  I use the marker as follows:
      <pre>
        function [ x, y ] = doodah ( a, b, c )
        
        %**********************************************************
        %
        %% DOODAH computes the mangletude of A hepcatted to B.
        %
        ...(further text of the routine follows)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      In each of the above cases, <b>CATALOG</b> will extract and print the line
      <blockquote>
         DOODAH computes the mangletude of A hepcatted to B.
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      Sample output of the program looks like this:
      <pre>

        The file is of FORTRAN type.

        Index of column.f90:

        COLUMN extracts a given column from a file.
        CHRCTI reads an integer from a string.
        CHRDB1 removes blanks from a string, left justifying the remainder.
        DIGTEN returns the integer value of a base 10 digit.
        WRDFND finds the word of a given index in a string.
        WRDNEXRD "reads" words from a string, one at a time.
      </pre>
