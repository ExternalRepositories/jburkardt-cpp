      HTMLINDEX <br> HTML Skeleton Page For a Routine Library
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HTMLINDEX</b> 
      is a C++ program which 
      builds a "skeleton" HTML page for
      a C, C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 source code file, documenting every
      routine in the file...<b>if</b> each routine has been appropriately
      marked.  The information after the marker is usually a one line
      explanations of what the routine does.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a C file, the special marker line has the form
      <pre>
        Purpose:

          ROUTINE has this purpose.
      </pre> 
    </p>

    <p>
      For a C++ file, the special marker line has the form
      <pre>
      // Purpose:
      //
      //    ROUTINE has this purpose.
      </pre> 
    </p>

    <p>
      For a FORTRAN77 file, the special marker line has the form
      <pre>
      cc ROUTINE has this purpose.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For a FORTRAN90 file, the special marker line has the form
      <pre>
      !! ROUTINE has this purpose.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      After a little editing, the page is ready for posting.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>htmlindex</b> <i>myprog.c</i> &gt; <i>myprog.html</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>myprog.c</i> is a C file to be processed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Similar commands work for C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 files.

      Related Data and Programs:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../cpp_src/catalog/catalog.html">
      CATALOG</a>,
      a C++ program which
      reads a C, C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 program and prints every line 
      that begins with a special index tag.  If the program has been marked
      up expecting this convention, it is a handy way of making a table
      of contents of a program file.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../f_src/extract/extract.html">
      EXTRACT</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which 
      extracts a subroutine, function or module by name from a FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 file.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../f_src/f77_cleanup/f77_cleanup.html">
      F77_CLEANUP</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      makes a copy of a FORTRAN77 file in which some minor cleanups have
      been made.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../c_src/f77split/f77split.html">
      F77SPLIT</a>,
      a C program which 
      reads a FORTRAN77 file and creates 
      individual files for every subroutine or function in the file.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../f_src/f90split/f90split.html">

    <p>
      <a href = "../../f_src/fixcon/fixcon.html">
      FIXCON</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which 
      reads a FORTRAN file that uses 
      FORTRAN77 continuation statements,
      and makes a copy that uses FORTRAN90 continuation instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../f_src/include_files/include_files.html">
      INCLUDE_FILES</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which 
      reads a FORTRAN program with INCLUDE
      statements, and makes a copy with the indicated files included.
