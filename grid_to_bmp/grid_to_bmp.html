    <p>
      <b>GRID_TO_BMP</b>
      is a C++ program which
      creates a Microsoft BMP color image file that represents
      scalar data read from a text file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The text file should contain the values of a quantity on an M by N
      grid, stored as an M by N array, which we will call "U".
    </p>

    <p>
      The first two records of the text file should contain the values of
      M and N, respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      There should follow M records, each of length N, containing, in order,
      the rows of U.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>grid_to_bmp</b> <i>input_file</i> <i>output_file</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>input_file</i> is the text file whose first two lines record the values of M and N,
          with each succeeding line containing the N values of the next row of data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>output_file</i> is the name of the output file, a BMP graphics file containing an image of
          the data.
        </li>
      </ul>
