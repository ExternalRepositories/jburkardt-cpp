      LF2CR <br> Convert Line Feeds to Carriage Returns
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LF2CR</b>
      is a C++ program which
      converts line feeds
      to carriage returns.
    </p>

    <p>
      I constantly run into problems, when transferring
      a file from one system to another, involving different conventions
      for ending a line of text.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is my understanding that the following "conventions" apply:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Macintosh (pre OSX) text lines end with the CR (carriage return) character;
        </li>
        <li>
          PC text lines end with the CR+LF (carriage return + line feed) characters;
        </li>
        <li>
          UNIX text lines end with the LF (line feed) character;
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p>

    <p>
      While your file transfer program will usually transfer a text file in such
      a way that that carriage control is properly translated, this sometimes doesn't
      happen, especially if the text file is transferred "verbatim", that is,
      as though it were a binary file.
    </p>

    <p>
      In such a case, <b>LF2CR</b> is the correct program to use if you want
      to convert a UNIX text file to a pre OSX Macintosh text file, since it
      will replace each occurrence of LF by CR.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>lf2cr</b> <i>old</i> <i>new</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>old</i> is the file to be modified;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>new</i> is the modified copy of the old file.
        </li>
      </ul>
